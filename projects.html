      <h2>Learning Journal PWA</h2>
      <p>
        This project is my Learning Journal Progressive Web App for FGCT6021 Mobile Application Development.
        The idea is to have a small web app where I can write weekly reflections, save them, and view them again later.
        I also experimented with different browser APIs to make it feel more interactive and “app-like”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app has three main pages: the home page, the journal page, and this projects page.
        The home page introduces the journal, the journal page handles writing and saving entries,
        and this page explains the main features and technical details of the project.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Features description -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Main Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write new journal entries and tag them by week (Week 1–4 or Other).</li>
        <li>Save entries so they stay even after refreshing or closing the browser.</li>
        <li>Filter existing entries by tag, e.g. only show “Week 2” entries.</li>
        <li>Word counter that updates as you type in the journal input box.</li>
        <li>Copy the latest entry to the clipboard with one button.</li>
        <li>Random learning quote from an external API to make the journal more motivating.</li>
        <li>Light/Dark theme switch that remembers the user’s choice using LocalStorage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- APIs used -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>APIs Used</h2>
      <h3>Storage API</h3>
      <p>
        I used the <strong>LocalStorage</strong> API to store my journal entries and the current theme.
        Each entry is saved as an object containing the text, a tag, and the date.
        When the journal page loads, the app reads from LocalStorage and rebuilds the list of entries in the DOM.
        The theme selection (light or dark) is also saved so the site remembers it on the next visit.
      </p>

      <h3>Browser APIs</h3>
      <p>
        For browser APIs, I used the <strong>Notifications API</strong> and the <strong>Clipboard API</strong>.
        When an entry is saved, the app requests notification permission and, if allowed, shows a small message
        saying that the journal entry was saved. The clipboard feature lets me copy the most recent entry,
        so I can paste it somewhere else if needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-Party API</h3>
      <p>
        For the third-party API, I used the public <strong>Quotable</strong> API. When the user clicks the
        “Get a Quote” button on the journal page, the app sends a fetch request to the API and displays a
        random quote with the author’s name. This makes the journal page feel a bit more inspirational and dynamic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works technically -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>How It Works (Technical Summary)</h2>
      <p>
        The project is built with HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. The header and footer are reused across all pages using
        JavaScript, and the theme is controlled by adding and removing CSS classes on the body element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journal logic is handled in a separate <code>storage.js</code> file, which manages saving, loading,
        and filtering entries. The browser-specific code (notifications and clipboard) lives in <code>browser.js</code>,
        and the external quote feature is in <code>thirdparty.js</code>. All of these are loaded on the journal page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this project helped me practise DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with different types of
        web APIs inside a small PWA-style site.
